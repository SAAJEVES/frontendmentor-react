## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Learnt more on the hover effect.

### Continued development

Working with images has been an issue for me. Sometimes I would want to use it as a background or create a div tag and place it inside. I had to use both methods on this project to get the one that was best especially when it comes to different media queries.

### Useful resources

A lot of resources was helpful not just in this project but from the beginning of my learning of web development.

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com)

- [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com)

- [youtube](https://www.youtube.com)

- And lots more. Surely, I will always recommend them days in and days out
